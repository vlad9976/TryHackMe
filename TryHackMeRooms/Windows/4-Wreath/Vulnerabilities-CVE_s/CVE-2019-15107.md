Start by cloning the repository. This can be done with the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/MuirlandOracle/CVE-2019-15107`  

This creates a local copy of the exploit on our attacking machine. Navigate into the folder then install the required Python libraries:

`cd CVE-2019-15107 && pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  

If this doesn't work, you may need to install pip before downloading the libraries. This can be done with:  
`sudo apt install python3-pip`  

The script should already be executable, but if not, add the executable bit (`chmod +x ./CVE-2019-15107.py`).

Never run an unknown script from the internet! Read through the code and see if you can get an idea of what it's doing. (Don't worry if you aren't familiar with Python -- in this case the exploit was coded by the author of this content and is being run in a lab environment, so you can infer that it isn't malicious. It is, however, good practice to read through scripts before running them).  

Once you're satisfied that the script will do what it says it will, run the exploit against the target!

`./CVE-2019-15107.py TARGET_IP`
