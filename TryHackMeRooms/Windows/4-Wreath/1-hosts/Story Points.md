From this we can take away the following pieces of information:

- There are three machines on the network
- There is at least one public facing webserver
- There is a self-hosted git server somewhere on the network
- The git server is internal, so Thomas may have pushed sensitive information into it  
    
- There is a PC running on the network that has antivirus installed, meaning we can hazard a guess that this is likely to be Windows
- By the sounds of it this is likely to be the server variant of Windows, which might work in our favour  
    
- The (assumed) Windows PC cannot be accessed directly from the webserver
