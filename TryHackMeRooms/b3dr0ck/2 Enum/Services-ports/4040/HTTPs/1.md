We're in the process of building a website! Can you believe this technology exists in bedrock?!?

Barney is helping to setup the server, and he said this info was important...

Hey, it's Barney. I only figured out nginx so far, what the h3ll is a database?!?
Bamm Bamm tried to setup a sql database, but I don't see it running.
Looks like it started something else, but I'm not sure how to turn it off...

He said it was from the toilet and OVER 9000!

Need to try and secure connections with certificates...
