From Three Million Bricks to Three Million Transactions!  

  

Brick Press Media Co. was working on creating a brand-new web theme that represents a renowned wall using three million byte bricks. Agent Murphy comes with a streak of bad luck. And here we go again: the server is compromised, and they've lost access.  
  

Can you hack back the server and identify what happened there?

  

**Note:** Add `10.10.61.223 bricks.thm` to your **/etc/hosts** file.
