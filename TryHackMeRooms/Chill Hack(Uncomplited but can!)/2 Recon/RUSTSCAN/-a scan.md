With RustScan, I scan ports so fast, even my firewall gets whiplash ðŸ’¨

[~] The config file is expected to be at "/home/kraken-pt/.rustscan.toml"
[!] File limit is lower than default batch size. Consider upping with --ulimit. May cause harm to sensitive servers
[!] Your file limit is very small, which negatively impacts RustScan's speed. Use the Docker image, or up the Ulimit with '--ulimit 5000'.
