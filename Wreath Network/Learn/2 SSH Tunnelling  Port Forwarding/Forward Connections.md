**Forward Connections**

Creating a forward (or "local") SSH tunnel can be done from our attacking box when we have SSH access to the target. As such, this technique is much more commonly used against Unix hosts. Linux servers, in particular, commonly have SSH active and open. That said, Microsoft (relatively) recently brought out their own implementation of the OpenSSH server, native to Windows, so this technique may begin to get more popular in this regard if the feature were to gain more traction.

There are two ways to create a forward SSH tunnel using the SSH client -- port forwarding, and creating a proxy.

- Port forwarding is accomplished with the `-L` switch, which creates a link to a **L**ocal port. For example, if we had SSH access to 172.16.0.5 and there's a webserver running on 172.16.0.10, we could use this command to create a link to the server on 172.16.0.10:  
    `ssh -L 8000:172.16.0.10:80 user@172.16.0.5 -fN`  
    We could then access the website on 172.16.0.10 (through 172.16.0.5) by navigating to port 8000 _on our own_ _attacking machine._ For example, by entering `localhost:8000` into a web browser. Using this technique we have effectively created a tunnel between port 80 on the target server, and port 8000 on our own box. Note that it's good practice to use a high port, out of the way, for the local connection. This means that the low ports are still open for their correct use (e.g. if we wanted to start our own webserver to serve an exploit to a target), and also means that we do not need to use `sudo` to create the connection. The `-fN` combined switch does two things: `-f` backgrounds the shell immediately so that we have our own terminal back. `-N` tells SSH that it doesn't need to execute any commands -- only set up the connection.  
      
    
- Proxies are made using the `-D` switch, for example: `-D 1337`. This will open up port 1337 on your attacking box as a proxy to send data through into the protected network. This is useful when combined with a tool such as proxychains. An example of this command would be:  
    `ssh -D 1337 user@172.16.0.5 -fN`  
    This again uses the `-fN` switches to background the shell. The choice of port 1337 is completely arbitrary -- all that matters is that the port is available and correctly set up in your proxychains (or equivalent) configuration file. Having this proxy set up would allow us to route all of our traffic through into the target network.
