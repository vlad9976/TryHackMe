  
The "[Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org/)" framework is a community-driven and frequently updated framework used solely to test the security of web applications and services.


The foundation regularly [writes reports](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/) stating the top ten security vulnerabilities a web application may have, the testing approach, and remediation.

| Easy to pick up and understand.                                                   | It may not be clear what type of vulnerability a web application has (they can often overlap). |
| Actively maintained and is frequently updated.                                    | OWASP does not make suggestions to any specific software development life cycles.              |
| It covers all stages of an engagement: from testing to reporting and remediation. | The framework doesn't hold any accreditation such as CHECK.                                    |
| Specialises in web applications and services.                                     | _Intentionally left blank._                                                                    |
