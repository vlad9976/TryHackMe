A few additional things to remember is that occasionally you may encounter files/folders with special characters such as - (dash). Just remember that if you try to copy or move these files you will encounter errors because Linux interprets the - as a type of argument, therefore you will have to place -- just before the filename. For example: cp -- -filename.txt /home/folderExample.
