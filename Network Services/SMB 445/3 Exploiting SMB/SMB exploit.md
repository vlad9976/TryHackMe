**Types of SMB Exploit  
**

While there are vulnerabilities such as [CVE-2017-7494](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-7494/) that can allow remote code execution by exploiting SMB, you're more likely to encounter a situation where the best way into a system is due to misconfigurations in the system. In this case, we're going to be exploiting anonymous SMB share access- a common misconfiguration that can allow us to gain information that will lead to a shell.  

**Method Breakdown**

So, from our enumeration stage, we know:

    - The SMB share location

    - The name of an interesting SMB share  

**SMBClient**

Because we're trying to access an SMB share, we need a client to access resources on servers. We will be using SMBClient because it's part of the default samba suite. While it’s already installed on the AttackBox, if you do need to install it on your own attacking machine, you can find the documentation [here.](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/smbclient.1.html)

We can remotely access the SMB share using the syntax:

`smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]`

Followed by the tags:

-U [name] : to specify the user

-p [port] : to specify the port  

**Got it? Okay, let's do this!**
