**What is Telnet?**

Telnet is an application protocol which allows you, with the use of a telnet client, to connect to and execute commands on a remote machine that's hosting a telnet server.  

The telnet client will establish a connection with the server. The client will then become a virtual terminal- allowing you to interact with the remote host.  

**Replacement**  

Telnet sends all messages in clear text and has no specific security mechanisms. Thus, in many applications and services, Telnet has been replaced by SSH in most implementations.  
   
****How does Telnet work?****

The user connects to the server by using the Telnet protocol, which means entering **"telnet"** into a command prompt. The user then executes commands on the server by using specific Telnet commands in the Telnet prompt. You can connect to a telnet server with the following syntax: **"telnet [ip] [port]"**
