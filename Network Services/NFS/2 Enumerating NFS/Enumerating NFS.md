**What is Enumeration?**

Enumeration is defined as "a process which establishes an active connection to the target hosts to discover potential attack vectors in the system, and the same can be used for further exploitation of the system." - [Infosec Institute](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/what-is-enumeration/). It is a critical phase when considering how to enumerate and exploit a remote machine - as the information you will use to inform your attacks will come from this stage

**Requirements**

In order to do a more advanced enumeration of the NFS server, and shares- we're going to need a few tools. The first of which is key to interacting with any NFS share from your local machine: **nfs-common**.

**NFS-Common**

It is important to have this package installed on any machine that uses NFS, either as client or server. It includes programs such as: **l****ockd, statd**, **showmount**, **nfsstat,** **gssd**, **idmapd** and **mount.nfs**. Primarily, we are concerned with "showmount" and "mount.nfs" as these are going to be most useful to us when it comes to extracting information from the NFS share. If you'd like more information about this package, feel free to read: [https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/nfs-common](https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/nfs-common).

You can install **nfs-common** using "_sudo apt install nfs-common_", it is part of the default repositories for most Linux distributions such as the Kali Remote Machine or AttackBox that is provided to TryHackMe.

**Port Scanning**

Port scanning has been covered many times before, so I'll only cover the basics that you need for this room here. If you'd like to learn more about **nmap** in more detail please have a look at the [nmap](https://tryhackme.com/room/furthernmap) room.

The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, open ports and operating system of the target machine. You can go as in-depth as you like on this, however, I suggest using **nmap** with the **-A** and **-p-** tags.

**Mounting NFS shares**

Your client’s system needs a directory where all the content shared by the host server in the export folder can be accessed. You can create  
this folder anywhere on your system. Once you've created this mount point, you can use the "mount" command to connect the NFS share to the mount point on your machine like so:

**sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock**

Let's break this down

|||
|---|---|
|**Tag**|**Function**|
|sudo|Run as root|
|mount|Execute the mount command|
|-t nfs|Type of device to mount, then specifying that it's NFS|
|IP:share|The IP Address of the NFS server, and the name of the share we wish to mount|
|-nolock|Specifies not to use NLM locking|
