In many cases, you can use source routing to force the packets to use a certain route to reach their destination. Nmap provides this feature using the option `--ip-options`. Nmap offers loose and strict routing:

- Loose routing can be specified using `L`. For instance, `--ip-options "L 10.10.10.50 10.10.50.250"` requests that your scan packets are routed through the two provided IP addresses.
- Strict routing can be specified using `S`. Strict routing requires you to set every hop between your system and the target host. For instance, `--ip-options "S 10.10.10.1 10.10.20.2 10.10.30.3"` specifies that the packets go via these three hops before reaching the target host.
